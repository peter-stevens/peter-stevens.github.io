                </div>

                <p>
                    This is
                    <a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0ByPaMZI9tuZEXzduWlQ3aXJQeFE">the script for my original hour-long television pilot</a>. 
                    A writing agent told me that an original series is as good as a spec script to 
                    showcase talent. I enjoyed the
                    <a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0ByPaMZI9tuZEX2RhQzFpMXJfaGM">episode I wrote</a>
                    for
                    <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0491738/">Psych</a>
                    but preferred crafting my own project.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Corrupt One is about exploring politics through story. The lessons of our ugly, beautiful democracy are played out in betrayals, ambitions, and the constant game to stay on top.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It was inspired by the cat-and-mouse rhythm of
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Note">Death Note</a>, the storytelling of
                    <a href="http://youtu.be/WyTDRf0eIEU?t=54s">Godfather II</a>, and my experiences in University.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The story follows the rise and fall of Thomas Kwon, an impressively corrupt student president. The kind of guy who has figured out how to gain direct access to the student council's funds, manipulate corporate sponsors, and secretly channel the money from a fundraiser to a cabal of ambitious, young student day traders in the business school. That's only the beginning of his agenda. Only Kwon knows how wide and deep his schemes run. Regular flashbacks reveal Kwon's transformation from innocent, lovesick, directionless first-year student to cold, calculated political beast.
                </p>

                <div class="punchleft">
                    <img src="/img/montreal-protest-may-31.jpeg" height=250px></div>

                <p>
                    Each episode shows Kwon backed into a corner by his growing list of enemies and ends with him staying two steps ahead. Ultimately, the ensemble of characters in the show will combine their efforts to destroy him.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Episodes are framed around "lessons" from political science (the Nixon-Kennedy debates, the First Triumvirate in Ancient Rome, etc.). In flashbacks we see Kwon learn these brutal truths the hard way, adapting to survive.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This sample script is the first of twelve episodes. We meet the ensemble cast and learn that the recent expulsion of the treasurer has created a power vacuum. Now, Kwon faces off with Hartwick for total control of the student government. It's The West Wing meets The Godfather meets a small campus in Southern Ontario. The show is sexy and intelligent, aimed at the 16 - 35 demographic with a particular appeal to the younger Obama generation, marked by their interest in politics, idealism, and Atlas Shrugged.
                </p>

                <p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>
