                <p>
I've had a happy reunion with the Art of Improv. My interest was rekindled by directing Hogtown Empire, returning to play at Catch 23, and performing and teaching at Theatre Ste. Catherine.
               </p>
			<p>
I've refined my approach to teaching improv. I spent a lot of time with eager newcomers in Montreal and it gave me a major insight into the craft. I entered into a new relationship with Improv. It reminded me of the stages I went through in my development as a high school teacher.
			</p>
			<p>
First, I think I'm a rock star. I loved getting positive feedback and I believed in the power of the individual teacher, meaning, I thought that if I taught Nietzsche in the most entertaining way possible it would be absorbed. Education was about my ability to perform the information.
			</p>
Once I had enough experience to see patterns emerging in my classes
			<p>
I, like most performers, looooove compliments. 
			</p>
			

I had habits that I didn't even know that I had.
			<p>
For example, (and this may seem sooooooo elementary but it's the first thing I notice about amateur improv) a decent scene needs a where and a who. 
			</p>
An isolated cabin in the woods. Winter. Two elderly women walk out the front door and into the snowy forest.
			<p>
You can imagine what happens next. You can't help it. Give the audience a location and characters and it let's their mind play. An audience will watch you happily for seven minutes in silence if they know where and who you are because their minds are on.
			</p>
If I'm a few minutes into a scene and where we are hasn't been mentioned I just do it. Like remembering my keys when I leave the house. It's a habit.
			<p>
Now, when I run a workshop, I do drills. I encourage practice to determine a short list of the habits that I think make me successful on stage.
			</p>
My new emphasis on finding and developing good improv habits has led to an exciting amount of discovery and clarity.
