         <h3>The Legacy of <i>The Revenant</i></h3>

<p>The legacy of <i>The Revenant</i> is twofold. First, it will have started the trend of actors looking directly at the camera in the final shot, pleading for an Oscar with their eyes. Second, it will be remembered as evidence of America's growing addiction to violence. The film went to extraordinary length to present itself as authentic in the harsh conditions it was shot and being based on the true story of Hugh Glass.</p>

<p>The film's pretensions of authenticity are best expressed by the scene in which we watch a pack of CGI wolves attack a CGI buffalo.</p>

<p>On screen, Glass is left for dead after a bear attack, watches Fitzgerald murder his son, and survives to get revenge. In reality, Glass was left for dead after a bear attack, no son, and survived to forgive Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>An extraordinary story of survival and forgiveness was rewritten as a tale of satisfying, justified revenge. We're watching a nation that has grown accustomed to lying to itself to justify violence. They invaded Iraq but there were no weapons of mass destruction. Look no further than <i>The Revenant</i> to understand why drone strikes are justified without public discussion.</p>
