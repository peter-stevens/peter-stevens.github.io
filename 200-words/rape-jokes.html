          <h3>Rape Jokes</h3>
<p>In 2012, a rape joke controversy led to question, "is rape appropriate for comedy?" Yes. Everything is. A better question is, "how is rape is used to get laughs?" This would have revealed the battle as our culture transitions from rape as an intellectual concept to rape as an emotional concept. Both sides feel offended when rape jokes do not enforce their perspective.</p>
<p>
rape is intellectual; an idea that cannot be topped 
VS
rape is emotional; a tragic human experience
</p>
<p>
Consider these jokes by Daniel Tosh:
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
"I play practical jokes on my sister. I replaced her pepper spray with silly string. Anyway, that night she got raped. She called me saying, you got me!"
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
“Wouldn’t it be funny if that girl got raped by like, five guys right now… like right now?”
</blockquote>
</p>
Here, comedy comes from exaggeration, presenting rape as a creative choice for the final beat in a joke. Door number one is forgetting an umbrella, door number two is forgetting your phone charger, door number three is being raped. This perspective lands with audiences who consider rape to be a funny idea; the last, extreme iteration of the joke. 
<p>
Consider these Sarah Silverman jokes:
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
"Who's going to complain about a rape joke? Rape victims? They're traditionally not complainers."
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
"I was raped by a doctor... which is so bittersweet for a Jewish girl."
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
The comedy comes from understatement, presenting rape as trauma. No one is asking the tough questions about those football players who raped that girl before their game: did they win? This perspective lands with audiences who understand rape as personal, intense, sacred, and misunderstood/neglected by mainstream media.
