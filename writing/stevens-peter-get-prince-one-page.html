<h2>
SETTING: ST. CLARENS ACADEMY
    </h2>
<p>
is a glorious campus, evoking all of our romantic European fantasies of grand halls, arches, stone, mountains, and a horse in a meadow. 
    </p>
<p>
St. Clarens has a storied tradition of grooming royalty and world leaders. Over the past fifty years, internationalism and new money has threatened their stodgy traditions.
</p>
            <p>
The school’s strict dress codes and archaic rituals are being eroded by the crass popularity war from the “new money” rich kids.
                </p>
<h2>
CHARACTERS
</h2>
            <h3>
LAURA
                </h3>
            <p>
Our hero. Positive. Proactive. Joyful with a dark side. Mastermind. Laura's constant joking and optimism is in stark contrast to her true feelings. She has a bleak view of human nature. </p>
<p>
Flashbacks reveal that, in grade 11, Laura ruled her high school as the Iron Bitch, an absolute, catty monster. Her family’s bankruptcy forced change upon her. She plummeted in popularity, was backstabbed by frenemies, and began to appreciate her family and make genuine friendships with the outsiders at her school. 
    </p>
<p>
Laura knows what it takes to claw to the top of the social food chain but does she want to reopen that part of herself? She’s also terrified that her motives will be exposed. Laura draws a lot of strength from her parents. The heart of this entire scheme is to keep them together. They hide their divorce from her.
    </p>
<h3>
THE PRINCE
    </h3>
            <p>
A mystery. We suspect he's a royal nice guy so a crass seduction will not work. We never see his face. The gold diggers endlessly craft their reputations to stay on his radar.

                </p>
            <h3>
BRITTNEY
                </h3>
            <p>
The competition. Dominant. Ruthless. Control. Brittney is a queen bee, a ruthless master of deception and gossip. She’s dead set on marrying the prince. 
                </p>
<h3>
QUINN
    </h3><p>
The rebel. Authentic. Trusting. Grounded. Quinn doesn’t think like the average, status-obsessed, St. Clarens student. He’s outside of the “keeping up with the Kardashians” mentality and anti-technology/social media. His parents are the head custodians, making him the only lower class student allowed to attend St. Clarens. He's an idealist, trusting, naive, and reliable. He challenges Laura's perspective that people are selfish, weak, and always on the verge of disappointing each other. 
            </p>
<h3>
HELENA
    </h3><p>
The artist. Wild. Controversial. Talented. She lives for pure art and experimentation, free from all obligations. She has very radical points of view about the sacred rights of the Earth, putting her in opposition to her family's fortune in global mining.
            </p>
<h3>
DIBBS
    </h3><p>
A tech savvy, Google Glass wearing, next-generation nerd. He's snarky because no one gives him the respect he deserves. Dibbs comes from the "new money" of Silicon Valley and refuses to accept the stigma of the 80s and 90s. This is 2015, the age of the nerd. His people run the world.
            </p>

<h3>
PRINCIPAL ZAISER
    </h3><p>
The draconian tyrant of St. Clarens. Her reputation has taken a serious hit because "new money" students have been mingling with "old money" students under her nose. She's hell-bent on expelling gold diggers. 
            </p>
<h3>
MS. LAMBERT
    </h3>
            <p>
An elderly guidance counselor who lived an enormous life of danger. She believes in taking risks.

<h3>
SENEGAL
    </h3><p>
Senegal, a former Lost Boy of Sudan, lets everyone know he was "saved" by a billionaire family. On the outside, he loves shopping, partying hard, and sailing. On the inside he is a scared little boy trying to fit in with these crazy rich people, wishing he was back at the refugee camp with his friends. He confides in Laura that he’s a prisoner in paradise. His name isn't even Senegal. That's an entirely different country in Africa. He was too afraid to correct his new parents.
            </p>
<h3>
RIYA
    </h3>
            <p>
A supermodel. Ambitious. Energy. Riya is from an Indian telecommunications fortune. She’s always dreamed about being a model. Now that she’s arrived, she’s not sure if that’s her calling. She has a big heart and any image of a child in poverty makes her want to give it all up to help them… but she can’t abandon Gucci. 
                </p>

<h2>
WHAT’S HONEST?
    </h2>

WHAT’S ENTERTAINING?
    </h2>
<p>
We're watching to the end of each episode to see if Laura will come out on top and get closer to marrying the prince. But is that what we want for her? Also, the absurdist comedy can take a left turn without signaling so you’re watching for a joke to blow up and pay off.
