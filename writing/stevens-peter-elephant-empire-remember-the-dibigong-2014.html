Office life is for chumps we were meant to run and drink and laugh. Not fax, who faxes? Why am I still sending faxes in this day and age, there are no fax machines in nature unless that's what the leaves in fall are. Thousands of tree faxes to nowhere...</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">HANNAH</p><p class="parenthetical">(overlapping)</p><p>These are perfect cottage conditions. I need to get in that water.

<div class="action"><p>During this explosion, the drive to the cottage begins.</p></div>

<div class="action"><p>Riot Cops beating a suspect.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>COP DAVE stops and thinks. Stops COP PETER to talk.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">COP DAVE</p><p>Do you think we're violent people and that's why we were drawn to the police force? Or. Is there something about the uniform and the power that makes one violent?</p></div>

<div class="action"><p>They resume beating suspect.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>Transition: fade to black. The image of the police beating a man freezes and becomes a constellation of stars.</p></div>

<h6>EXT. GEORGIAN BAY. NIGHT. SUMMER. 3AM.</h6>
<div class="action"><p>Four friends in a small boat.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>They are lit by their flashlights and the glow of a fish finder and a few pieces of video and audio equipment.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>SUPER: Somewhere on Georgian Bay. 3am.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">CONNELL</p><p>I'm going on the record. They're all made up. The Dibigong. Loch Ness. Bigfoot. Ogopog.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JERZY</p><p>Ogopogo.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">HAILEY</p><p>Do you know the name of the snake that eats itself?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JERZY</p><p>Oroboros? That&#8217;s more of a symbol than a cryptid.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">MANNY</p><p>So what's a two-headed bird?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JERZY</p><p>Like a Byzantine crest or a Gandaberunda?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">CONNELL</p><p>Ugh. Also, for the record, wizard here is the only of us who went into the sciences.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JERZY</p><p>Technically, this is pseudoscientific because the Dibigong lacks falsifiability. Karl Popper argued that science-</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">CONNELL</p><p class="parenthetical">(overlapping groan)</p><p>Boring.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">MANNY</p><p class="parenthetical">(overlapping)</p><p>Okay, professor.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">HAILEY</p><p class="parenthetical">(overlapping)</p><p>I study literature.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JERZY</p><p>I forgot you're all arts students.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">HAILEY</p><p>Hey ,"for the record", do you believe there's any creature that hasn't been discovered?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">CONNELL</p><p>Maybe in the deepest part of the ocean.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JERZY</p><p>Technically, we're connected to the Atlantic the ocean.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">CONNELL</p><p>Wow.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">MANNY</p><p>It's healthy to keep some wonder about the universe.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">HAILEY</p><p>All I'm saying is you're on the boat too.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">CONNELL</p><p>This was all JERZY's idea.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">MANNY</p><p>It's fun. It's great we're all back for the summer.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">HAILEY</p><p>I agree. If you lived near Loch Ness wouldn't you put in one night, in a boat, looking for Nessie?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">CONNELL</p><p>It's amazing to me that a sailor in 1800 would be on the bay, see a rock in the fog and say, "blimey, it's a monstey", and a couple of hundred years later we -Dibigong! The Dibigong!</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>All look.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">CONNELL</p><p class="parenthetical">(laughing)</p><p>Guys. It's made up. That's so sad you all looked.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>MANNY splashes CONNELL.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">MANNY</p><p>No false alarms.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JERZY</p><p>It wasn't a sailor it was a dentist on his yacht and the year was 1923.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">HAILEY</p><p>Memory like a steel trap.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">CONNELL</p><p>What was the full name of our teacher in elementary school?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>JERZY</p><p>Don Temple. Grade 5.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">HAILEY</p><p>Speed!</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">CONNELL</p><p>Hold on. What did Mr. Temple dress up for on Halloween?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JERZY</p><p>David Suzuki.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">MANNY AND HAILEY</p><p>Whoa!</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">CONNELL</p><p>Every teacher was Suzuki at some point. Just because he acts certain doesn't mean he's got a good memory.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">MANNY</p><p>Mr. Temple was a cool teacher.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JERZY</p><p>No he wasn't.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">HAILEY</p><p>Oh, the science report!</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">MANNY</p><p>What?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">CONNELL</p><p>You don't remember? Mr. Temple had all these tubes and boiled water for-</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">MANNY</p><p>I don't think I was there that day.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JERZY</p><p>You were.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">HAILEY</p><p>Remember? We had to do a group report?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">MANNY</p><p class="parenthetical">(remembers)</p><p>Did we fight about it?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">CONNELL</p><p>Oh we fought! Because Mr. Temple set up all his science stuff and it didn't work at all.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">HAILEY</p><p>So he just told the class what was supposed to happen.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JERZY</p><p>So corrupt.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">CONNELL</p><p>But then on our group science report said &#8220;write down what you saw.&#8221;</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">HAILEY</p><p>And JERZY insisted on describing how the experiment failed.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JERZY</p><p>Because that's what happened.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">CONNELL</p><p>We knew what we were supposed to write.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">MANNY</p><p>I don't think I remember this. Was Mr. Temple the one who threw chalk?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">CONNELL</p><p>Did he?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JERZY</p><p>That was Mr. Polomo. He threw chalk at the kid who broke the chair during an indoor recess-</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>The large, scaly back of the Dibigong rises out of the lake, brushing the boat.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>The friends stand. Rising shout. HAILEY, closest to the beast, reaches out, touches it.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>The boat is rocked, tipped over. HAILEY falls in the boat. The rest fall overboard. Flashlights dropped.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>SPLASHING.</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">MANNY</p><p>I'm here. Where's JERZY?</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">JERZY</p><p>Here. We're all here.</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">HAILEY</p><p>Get in the boat!</p></div>
<div class="dialog"><p class="character">MANNY</p><p>It's cold.</p></div>
<div class="action"><p>All climb into boat.</p></div>

<div class="dialog"><p class="character">HAILEY</p><p>It was warm.</p></div>
