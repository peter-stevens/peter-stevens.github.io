<h1>
Warsport
    </h1>


      <p>
For millennia, massive galactic wars have melted planets and crushed civilizations. After The Great Oops, bloodshed was declared too costly for life in the universe. 
    </p>
 <p>
The Cosmic Union replaced war with sport. All interplanetary conflicts are to be settled by organized games. Five Diplomats versus Five Diplomats.
    </p>
    <p>
Today, Warsport is the cosmos’ favourite pastime with centillions of fans, pro leagues in each quadrant, planet, and province of the galazy, and arenas in every skycity, ice meadow, needle forest, bog, subterraneon farm, schoolyard -all you need is a field, a ball, and let the war begin!
    </p>
        <p>
Every child, egg, and spud in the universe dreams of playing in The Big Game of the Alpha League Championships.
</p>

            <h2>
THE SET UP
                </h2>
           <p>
You could care less about Warsports. You play as Hoffy Vam-a-dan, a fast-talking liar and a loser. You’re a penniless, aging, scam artist running from your creditors, the law, and the alien families that you bankrupted. You’re desperate, destitute, and in serious organ debt to multiple mobs. You’re done dreaming big… it’s time to put yourself out of your misery. </p>
    <p>
But then a child pulled on your coat, begging for help. So you stepped up and coached her little league friends to a schoolyard victory. You discovered your power. Your fast-talking deception has given you a knack for motivational halftime speeches. Now you’ve had a vision:
        </p>
        <p>YOU as manager of your own Warsport team.
</p>

   
<h2>
YOUR QUEST
    </h2>
 
    <p>
You’re starting below the bottom. Your mission is to hustle a squad together, grind out wins in the black market leagues, and build your roster and reputation.
        </p>
<p>
    Raise funds, buy a new identity, acquire a spaceship, get off planet and into the bigger game. There’s colossal coin to be made for mercenaries in political sports.</p>
    <p> 
        Seek out the rejects of the galaxy. Assemble a team of hopeless misfits and complete their sidequests to unlock their potential. Upgrade your crew into a cash-winning dynasty of legendary Diplomats. And, who knows, maybe an appearance in the elite Alpha League? 
    </p>
<p>
It seems like half the universe is trying to take your money, your team, and your life. But, hey, it’s okay. As long as you have your head you can stay a step ahead. You’re gonna make it. You’re dreaming big again. 
    </p>
<p>
Just win, baby. It’s your only shot at redemption.
</p>
    <p>
Game on.
        </p>

<h2>
CHARACTERS
</h2>
    
<p>
    There are 41 characters to unlock. 
    </p>
    
<h3>
HOFFY VAMADAN
</h3>
<P>
Coach Vam was a fast-talking liar, a cheat, and a scoundral. You've made mistakes and crossed a lot of people. Initially, you're in Warsports for the big, fast money that can save your skin. Your quest is constantly sidetracked by your troubled past. You're juggling space cops, bankrupted families, organ harvesters, ex-partners, vengeful mobsters, and an innocent child whose scooter you stole (you were in a bad place). 
    </p>
    <p>
Once your team gets off the ground you have a chance to make good... or make worse.
    </P>
<P>
Your journey becomes about helping your players. At the outset, they are a means to an end. But as you get involved with their sidequests you grow attached to them. They look to you for leadership. </p> 
<p>    
In the end, you get your house in order and have a shot to become Alpha League champions with a team so loyal that they would die for their coach.
</P>

    <h3>
1011
        </h3>
    <p>
Ten Eleven is a broken robot, inside and out. You found him weeping in a trash bin, unable to fulfill its prime function: crushing wobo nuts as a cafe barista. As you travel around the cosmos, you’ll be salvaging machine parts to weld together a unique, elite Warsport robot. 
</p><p>
In the end, you merge Ten Eleven with an industrial wobo nut crushing machine, fulfilling his heart's desire. Satisfied, he returns to you, choosing to move past his prime function. He reaches elite player level and inspires all robots.
</p>
<h3>
    BROTHER DELICATE FLOWER
    </h3>
    <p>
A monk with sublime agility who believes in nonviolence. 
</p>
    <h3>
THE UNAMED
        </h3>
    <p>
We all know the tall tale of the disgraced MVP from the old days of the Alpha League. Rumour has it, a player was erased from Warsport history for shaving points. The legends say he was executed, his records were deleted, and his name was taken. You’ve got a gut feeling that these rumours are true. You follow clues, dig up the corpse, and have illegal witches resurrect the body. You throw those bones in a sack and put it on the field. 
</p><p>
In the end, you discover fragments of The Unnamed’s history, remove his curses and uncover his name, restoring him to elite player level.
    </p>
<h3>
    EBO TERRANIAN
    </h3>
    <p>
Ebo is eternally guilty for selling his children into slab-hauling slavery. Over thirty years, those clever kids worked their way up to becoming valuable, savvy merchant servants of the rich. The current cost of their freedom is astronomical. You can help Ebo raise funds to free them. 
        <p>
In the end, Ebo buys his childrens' freedom but they want nothing to do with him. Terranian dedicates himself to freeing slaves. First, he buys the freedom of his children's friends. Ebo is driven to reach elite player level to make enough money to free every slave in the universe. Then, at one game, the children show up to cheer for their Dad. They want to begin the process of forgiveness. 
            </p>
        
    <h3>
    A PILE OF ROCKS
    </h3>
    <p>
One of the first "players" you acquire. You're in a pretty low place to let a literal pile of rocks join your team. In the beginning, it doesn't move. It takes quite a few games for it to grow legs and arms as your team's reputation builds. You have a chance to explore its backstory once fans start to buy "Pile of Rocks" jerseys. 
    
    <p>Turns out, this pile of rocks is a god. Hundreds of years ago, it was a vengeful, fear-based deity who punished its followers with earthquakes. But their civilization discarded the god after developed earthquake-proofing technology. 
        </p>
    <p>
In the end, religious scholars reinterpret the scriptures. Ooawtato (Ooh-awt-a-toe) is welcomed back as the god of Warsports: passion, sacrifice, and teamwork. The Pile of Rocks is a deity once more, loved and worshipped by its entire home planet, reaching elite player level.

<h2>
GAMEPLAY
    </h2>

<h4>            
The Sport
    </h4>
<p>
Warsport is 5v5, played on field with a ball. It's simplicity gives it intergalactic appeal. There are local variations but the core rules are the same.
<p>
A point is scored when a player has possesion of the ball in the endzone. 
</p>
<p>
Generally, players run with the ball, avoid tackles, and throw it to teammates. Play never stops. 
    </p>
<h4>
The Controls
    </h4>
    <p>
For every action (tackle, deke, catch, throw) the user can choose to act neutral or press the "finesse" or "brute force" button.
        </p>
    <h4>
    Player Development
    </h4>
    <p>
New abilities are unlocked through XP and reaching certain narrative milestones in a player's sidequest. The path to "elite player level" is only open once their sidequest is complete. You'll need seven team members to reach "elite player level" to play in the big leagues.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>
WHAT’S HONEST?
    </h2>
<p>
Redemption stories are at the heart of this silly universe. You lie to him nonstop about the holy purpose of the team.
    </p>
<h2>
WHAT’S INFORMATIVE?
    </h2>
<p>
A rich galaxy of diverse planets and characters. Users can uncover the backstories of any character on their team by entering their sidequest.
    </p>
<h2>
WHAT’S ENTERTAINING?
    </h2>
<p>
Gameplay, like all sports, is repetitive. We enjoy how practive makes us better, having clear victory goals,  and unlocking new powers.
