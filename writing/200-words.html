                <h6 id="placing-canadian-comedy">MARCH 2016</h6><h3>Placing Canadian Comedy Between American and British</h3>

<p>Let's place Canadian comedy between American and British stlyes.</p>

<p>The British sense of humour is sophisticated and dark. They prize wordplay, subtlety, and irony because they love layers of meaning. After all, a great joke is measured by the time it takes to get it (and a few casualties will miss it altogether). A dark ending is essential so that cynics can relive the fall of the British Empire. The pinnancle of British comedy is an innocent family being executed because of a typo and a cowardly bureaucrat covering it up to save their job.</p>

<p>The American sense of humour is crass and celebatory. They favour big characters and being loud because they love having everyone in on the joke. American comedy is obvious, physical and grotesque, dealing with all of our favourite orifices. A happy ending is a must. The pinnacle of American comedy is a Big Lug farting so loud that it leads to a happy marriage and rescues the auto industry.</p>

<p>Canadian comedy hits a sweet spot, borrowing a sense of tragedy from the British while struggling to be as welcoming as the Americans. It is part physical and part clever. We shy away from saying fart and would never use malapropism or a big word like malapropism. Endings can be sad but you've gained a friend in a cute dog.</p>
                
<p>As a sidenote, the ruthless Aussies will laugh themselves silly screaming insults at a toad as it is mulched by a lawnmower.</p>

                <h6 id="totalitarianism">MARCH 2016</h6><h3>Totalitarianism</h3>

<p>Totalitarianism is a fancy word for a system of total control. Imagine a government that wants to influence every part of your life: the books on your shelf, the files on your device, the conversations with your friends -even the thoughts in your head.</p>

<p>Perfect loyalty is impossible so we're all guilty, living in constant fear of arrest and execution, suspicious and hateful of neighbours. From the 1930s to the 1990s, our culture lived in fear of this system. Our books and movies expressed criticism and hatred of the totalitarian villains: The Soviet Union (Stalin), Nazi Germany (Hitler), and Communist China (Mao).</p>

<p>The villains are gone. Now, in 2016, our culture arrived at totalitarianism from a different direction: consumer individualism. Our devices report our locations, our writing is archived by others, and "cookies" track that you're reading this right now. Corporations pay for this information to improve marketing. Our government wants access to improve policing.</p>

<p>We censor ourselves. We live with awareness that we're being tracked, recorded, and profiled. These services are not free. We pay with our privacy. These are dangerous tools in a peaceful time. But not all times are peaceful.</p>

                <h3>Rape Jokes</h3>
<p>In 2012, a rape joke controversy was simpified into the question, "is rape appropriate for comedy?" Yes. Everything is. A better question is, "how is rape is used to get laughs?" This would have revealed the current battle in our culture, as we transition from rape as an intellectual concept to rape as an emotional concept. Both sides feel offended when rape jokes do not enforce their perspective.</p>
<p>rape is an abstraction, a big idea that cannot be one-upped </p>
                <p>VS</p>
<p>rape is an experience, a tragedy</p>
<p>Consider these jokes by Daniel Tosh:</p>
<p><blockquote>
"I play practical jokes on my sister. I replaced her pepper spray with silly string. Anyway, that night she got raped. She called me saying, you got me!"
</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>
“Wouldn’t it be funny if that girl got raped by like, five guys right now… like right now?”
</blockquote></p>
<p>Here, comedy comes from exaggeration, presenting rape as a creative choice for the final beat in a joke. So often in comedy, the comedian searches for the top of the premise. Example: door number one is forgetting an umbrella, door number two is forgetting your phone charger, door number three is you get raped. This perspective lands with audiences who consider rape to be a funny concept, the last, extreme iteration in a classic joke structure.</p>
<p>Consider these Sarah Silverman jokes:</p>
<p><blockquote>
"Who's going to complain about a rape joke? Rape victims? They're traditionally not complainers."
</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>
"I was raped by a doctor... which is so bittersweet for a Jewish girl."
</blockquote></p>
<p>The comedy comes from understatement, presenting rape as trauma. Example: No one in the media asked the important question after those high school football players raped that girl... did they win? This perspective lands with audiences who understand rape as personal, intense, sacred, and misunderstood/neglected by mainstream media.</p>
<p>This is a small example in a larger trend. The insights of feminism and postcolonialism have opened our culture's eyes, added voices to the conversation, and moved our comedy from abstraction to lived.</p>

                <h3>I Never Get Emotional is an Extremely Emotional Thing to Say</h3>
<p>
    A weeping crybaby, blubbering through tears is clearly emotional. But so too is a calm, stone-faced adult, speaking in a measured voice, "let's be rational. You always do this."</p>

<p>Consider that emotional means "thinking in extremes". Yes, red faces and tears are a good indication of intense feelings but our faces can hide our thoughts. Intense emotion lives in language like: "you never...", "this always happens", "this is the worst", "they're the best", etc. 
</p>
            <p>
"I am logical. I never get emotional," is an extremely emotional thing to say. 
            </p>
<p>I came across similar thinking when reading literature about living with grief. We often remember our loved ones as total saints or sinners. I was rereading George W. Bush's Axis of Evil speech (2002). This is a prime example of intense emotion masquerading as rational: "our first priority must ALWAYS be the security of our nation" and "the price of freedom and security is high, it is NEVER too high."</p>

                <h3>The Legacy of <i>The Revenant</i></h3>

<p>The legacy of <i>The Revenant</i> is twofold. First, it will have started the trend of actors looking directly at the camera in the final shot, pleading for an Oscar with their eyes. Second, it will be remembered as the moment America's love of violence became pathological. The film went to extraordinary length to present itself as authentic. It was shot on chilly mornings and based on the story of Hugh Glass (1783-1833).</p>

<p>The film's pretensions of authenticity are best expressed by the scene in which we watch a pack of CGI wolves attack a CGI buffalo. Why did this hilarious fact not prevent the film promoting itself as Truth? We are primed to lie to ourselves.</p>

<p>On screen, Glass is left for dead after a bear attack, watches Fitzgerald murder his son, and survives to get revenge. In history, Glass was left for dead after a bear attack, no son, and survived to forgive Fitzgerald.</p>

<p>An extraordinary story of survival and forgiveness was rewritten as a tale of satisfying, justified revenge. We're watching a nation that has grown accustomed to lying to itself to justify violence. They invaded Iraq but there were no weapons of mass destruction. Look no further than <i>The Revenant</i> to understand why drone strikes are justified without public discussion and why they fail to make sense of school shootings.</p>
